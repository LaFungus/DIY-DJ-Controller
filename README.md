Hello. this is a DIY dj controller, I designed by myself. 
I hope someone will like it.

V1 - the original files DO NOT PRINT THEM - no screw holes, stands for the parts to properly connect.

V2 - together with V3 files is the newest and best variation of the design. Added m3 screw doles, standoffs, so the top parts will be sturdier.

V3 - not really a V3, just some minor improvements added to some of V2 parts.

IMPORTANT - print V3 files, if there isn't a V3 for your file, print the V2, and if there is no V2, print the original.
